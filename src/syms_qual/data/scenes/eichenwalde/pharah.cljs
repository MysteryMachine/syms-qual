There seems to be no one on the enemy team capable of dealing with Pharah’s aerial offense and her cover fire allows you, Ana, and Reinhardt to easily move through the choke point. Once you are through, Ana splits off to take the high ground, allowing her to safely provide long distance healing as the rest of you fight to capture control of the payload. Once the battering ram is in your possession, you manage to quickly traverse the rest of the map, taking  the second and the third points with ease."

Once the round starts however, it becomes evident that most of the enemy team has decided to abandon the match. As you wait for the time limit on the round to expire, you sit with Pharah and Reinhardt in front of the payload while Ana lurks some distance off, crouched on the sniper’s perch on the far side of the point."
