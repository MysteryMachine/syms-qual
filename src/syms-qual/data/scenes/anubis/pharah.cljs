    "Your team’s offense had apparently been stifled rather quickly, going four versus six. Mercy was quite visibly upset, and shot some nasty looks at Pharah, who was incapable of returning eye contact. The rest of the team did not seem to mind much though. Genji was quietly aloof and Reinhardt and Zarya’s drunken teasing about your romantic getaway occupied much more of the conversation than the upcoming defense."
    "You all held the first objective until overtime, and it seemed like the match might go the way of a tie, but a well placed scatter arrow eliminated you, your teleporter, and your team’s hopes of further contesting the point."
